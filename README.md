# Warcraft Recorder

A desktop screen recorder application that records and saves videos of in-game events, and provides a graphical user interface to view the replays. 

Nothing magic happens here, the application watches the combat log file for events, records to disk and then plays back the recordings in the user interface.

#  How to Use
1. Download and run the installer from the releases section.
1. Launch the application and fill out the settings page. 
1. Enable combat logging in-game, I recommend the [SimpleCombatLogger](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/simplecombatlogger) addon for this. 

#  Release Status

The initial `1.0.0` release is lacking in several areas. If something doesn't work as you expect, please check the open issues. 

# Bug Reports & Suggestions

Please create an issue, I will get to it eventually. Please bear in mind maintaining this is a hobby for me, so it may take me some time to comment. If you think you can improve something, feel free to submit a PR.

# Motivation

This project is free and open source software. It is built on the [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate) repository. It is released in the hope that it will be useful to other players.
